MHDCT Details
=============

This section gives a detailed account of incorporating MHDCT into your
simulation.  Please read the overview in :ref:`mhd_methods` first.  Also,
read the implementation method paper, Collins et al 2010.

Parameter Compatibility
-----------------------

Due to the consistency requirements of MHDCT, several parameter combinations can
and will fail in hilarious ways.  Defaults have been
selected to give the best performance and the consistent results.  The minimum
set of parameters to be enabled in your new parameter file are

``NumberOfGhostZones = 5``

``HydroMethod = 6``

Other parameters must always be set, and sometimes are set differently in other
parameter files:

``FluxCorrection = 1``

``CorrectParentBoundaryFluxes = 1``

Initialization
--------------

If you have an initializer that you wish to add ``MHDCT`` to, several things
need to be done:

1.) **Set Labels and Units** Define the labels in the primary problem initializer, e. g. ``MHDBlastInitialize.C``.  
Use the function ``MHDCTSetupFieldLabels();``

2.) Note: if your main initializer uses a call to ``InitializeUniformGrid``, you can skip steps 2 and 3.
In the grid initializer, e.g. ``Grid_MHDBlastInitializeGrid.C``, add
``BaryonField`` pointers for the centered magnetic field.  Code should look like

.. code-block:: c

    if( UseMHD ){
      FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield1;
      FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield2;
      FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield3;
    }
    if( HydroMethod == MHD_RK ){
      FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = PhiField;
    }

This is the same as Dedner simulation.  Old versions of the code used a variable ``CenteredB``, which was redundant and cumbersome.

3.) **Allocate the appropriate fields** 
Ensure your code calls ``this->AllocateGrids();`` rather than
``BaryonField[field] = new float[size]``.  


4.) **Fill the Fields**  This can be either very straight forward, or very
difficult depending on your problem.  Here we'll present three cases.  Note that
the very most important thing is that the field is **numerically** divergence
free.  

4a) **Uniform Magnetic Fields** If you have a uniform magnetic field defined by ``UniformField[3]``, you can initialize them like this:

.. code-block:: c

  for ( int field=0; field < 3; field++ ){
    for ( int i=0; i<MagneticSize[field]; i++ ){
      MagneticField[field][i] = UniformField[field];
    }

  }

Here, ``MagneticSize[]`` is defined in ``grid::AllocateGrids``.  In some initializers this is done within the ``i,j,k`` loop
over ``BaryonField``.  This is also acceptable, the missing face will be taken care of by the boundary set on the root grid.


4b) **Simple Analytic Function** If you have a function, ``Function``, that is *numerically*
divergence free but a function of space,  you can loop over the grids
zone-by-zone in the following manner.  **NOTE that your function is probably not
like this**  Many functions are analytically divergence free, but numerically
they are not.  Piecewise constant functions are possible candidates, anything
involving sine is not.

.. code-block:: c

  for ( int field=0; field < 3; field++ ){
    for ( k=0; k<MagneticDims[field][2]; k++ ){
      for( j=0; j<MagneticDims[field][1]; j++ ){
        for( i=0; i<MagneticDims[field][0]; i++ ){
          index = i + MagneticDims[field][0]*(j + MagneticDims[field][1] * k);
          MagneticField[ field][ index] = Function(i,j,k);
        }
      }
    }
  }
 
4c) **Anything Else** For any function that is more complex than a Heaviside
function, you will need to write your initial magnetic field as the curl of a
vector potential, :math:`B = \nabla \times A`.    The curl operator,
``grid::MHD_Curl``, will allow you to take any field you like to initialize the
field.  Due to data structure limitations, we use the ``ElectricField`` to store
the vector potential in this case.  Such code might look like this:

.. code-block:: c

    for ( int field=0; field < 3; field++ ){
        for ( k=0; k<ElectricDims[field][2]; k++ ){
          for( j=0; j<ElectricDims[field][1]; j++ ){
            for( i=0; i<ElectricDims[field][0]; i++ ){
              index = i + ElectricDims[field][0]*(j + ElectricDims[field][1] * k);
              ElectricField[ field ][ index] = Function(field,i,j,k);
            }
          }
        }
      }
      this->MHD_Curl(GridStartIndex, GridEndIndex, 0)

where ``Function`` is anything you like.  

5.) **Center the magnetic field**  The final step is to fill the centered field, ``BaryonField[B1Num]`` (etc) from ``MagneticField``.  Call this
function once you've filled ``MagneticField``.

.. code-block:: c

    this->CenterMagneticField();


6.) **Add to the Energy** Finally you need to add the magnetic energy to the total
energy.  There are several ways to accomplish this.  Something like this is
sufficient:

.. code-block:: c

  int DensNum, GENum, Vel1Num, Vel2Num, Vel3Num, TENum, B1Num, B2Num, B3Num;
  this->IdentifyPhysicalQuantities(DensNum, GENum, Vel1Num, Vel2Num, Vel3Num, 
                                   TENum, B1Num, B2Num, B3Num);
  for( i=0; i<size; i++ ){
    BaryonField[ TENum][i] += 0.5*(BaryonField[B1Num][i]*BaryonField[B1Num][i]+
                                   BaryonField[B2Num][i]*BaryonField[B2Num][i]+
                                   BaryonField[B3Num][i]*BaryonField[B3Num][i])/BaryonField[ DensNum][i];
  }  


7.) **If you refine on initialization** Some problems refine on initialization.
If you have such an initializer, quite often the grid initializer is called on
successive levels, then projected from fine to coarse.  If your routine does
this, **AND** you have a simple (i.e. you didn't call ``MHD_Curl``) initializer,
you can force the magnetic field to be projected by setting

.. code-block:: c

    MHD_ProjectB=TRUE;
    MHD_ProjectE=FALSE;

before the projection is done.  *It is imperative* that it gets set back after
the projection with 

.. code-block:: c

    MHD_ProjectB=FALSE;
    MHD_ProjectE=TRUE;

or the code will fail horribly.

**If you refine on initialization and have a complex initializer** you will need
to project the electric field, then take the curl over the whole grid.  I have
never done this, so writing documentation would be speculative at best.  Please
feel free to contact David Collins through the Enzo mailing list in such a case, and I can both help make it happen and write the document.


Data Structures
---------------

Enzo uses two representations of the magnetic field, one located at the center
of the zone and one at the face.  The centered field is stored in
``BaryonField``, and will use identical code to the field with the Dedner
solver.
The staggered magnetic field is stored in ``MagneticField``, and electric field, ``ElectricField``, is 
centered on the zone edges.  ``MagneticField``, being stored on the faces of the
zones, has one additional point along each component.  For instance, if a ``grid`` had dimensions :math:`n_x, n_y, n_z` then
:math:`B_x` will have dimensions :math:`n_x+1, n_y, n_z`.  ``ElectricField`` has additional points transverse to the direction
of the component, so :math:`E_x` has dimensions :math:`n_x, n_y+1, n_z+1`.
There are several helper variables, such as ``MagneticDims[3][3]``,
``ElectricDims[3][3]``, ``MagneticSize[3]``, and ``ElectricSize[3]`` to describe
these variables.

The centered magnetic field will be updated by ``grid::CenterMagneticField()``
used strategically throughout the code.

Note that old versions of the code incorporate an additional data structure,
``CenteredB``, to store the cell centered field.  This has been removed, and
should be replaced by ``BaryonField[B1Num]``, etc.

For ``MHDCT``, the magnetic field stored in ``BaryonField``
should be considered a read-only quantity-- it is
replaced with a centered spatial average of ``MagneticField`` as necessary by
the routine ``CenterMagneticField``.  
``MagneticField`` should only be modified in a manner that is definitely
divergence free.  For more general initialization, one can use the function ``MHD_Curl``
for fields that can be represented by a vector potential.  

Interpolation
------------- 

Interpolation must be done in a divergence-free manner.  Balsara
2001 describes this method.  Interpolation is done on all three components of
``MagneticField`` at once.  This method only allows ``RefineBy = 2``.  

One challenge of this method is that newly interpolated regions require
knowledge of any fine-grid data at the same level that may share a face.  Thus
instead of simply interpolating from parent grids, then copying from old fine
grids, MHDCT must use the magnetic information from the old fine grids.  This is
done by first computing interpolation derivatives (done in ``Grid_MHD_CID.C``
and stored in ``DyBx``, etc) then communicating this information to the relevant
parent grids (done in ``Grid_SendOldFineGrids.C``)  This makes MHD-CT
interpolation a 3 grid interaction (Parent, Child, Old Child) rather than a 2
body interaction (Parent and Child) as all other fields.

Projection and Flux Correction
------------------------------

As with other quantities, magnetic fields need to be projected to parents, then
coarse zones next to projected zones need to be corrected to ensure
conservation.  As described by Balsara 2001, this involves area weighted
projection of face centered field on the fine grid, then a correction using the
electric field.  In order to simplify the logic and machinery, Enzo MHD-CT
actually projects the ``ElectricField``, then takes the curl over the new
magnetic field.  This is formally equivalent to projection plus flux correction,
but doesn't have as many cases to check and grid interactions to worry about.
This is done in ``EvolveLevel`` by the routine ``Grid_MHD_UpdateMagneticField``
