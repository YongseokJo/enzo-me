.. _AddingANewTestProblem:

Adding a new Test Problem.
==========================

This is the best place to start your Enzo Development Career. Even
if you're not interested in actually writing a new problem
generator, in this page I'll discuss the basic Enzo data structures
and programming patterns.

One deficiency in this tutorial is the lack of Particles. This is
not an oversight, but due to the fact that the author of the
article doesn't really use particles, as he's not a cosmologist.
These will be added in the future, but particles are really not
that big of a deal when it comes to the general Enzo data 
structures. All the information herein is still essential.

Overview
--------

Essentially, you need two write files: ``MyProblemInitialize.C`` and
``Grid_MyProblemInitializeGrid.C``. We'll be discussing these two
files. ``MyProblemInitialize`` is the basic setup code that sets up
parameters and the hierarchy, and ``MyProblemInitializeGrid`` is a
member function of the grid class, and actually allocates and
assigns data. There are several pitfalls to setting up these files,
so read these pages carefully.

We strongly recommend reading everything that proceeds this page on
the :doc:`../user_guide/index` page and the page about version control
and regression testing, :doc:`ModificationIntro`.

Lastly, please give your problem a reasonable name. I'll be using
``MyProblem`` throughout this tutorial. Please change this to something
that reflects the problem you're installing.

Adding Setup Files and Defining a New Problem Type
--------------------------------------------------

Please follow the general Enzo naming convention and call your
routines ``MyProblemInitialize`` and store it in ``MyProblemInitialize.C``,
and ``MyProblemInitializeGrid`` and store it in
``Grid_MyProblemInitializeGrid.C``

You'll need to install your code in three places.

.. highlight:: none

#. ``Make.config.objects``
    is the file that lists all the source file objects needed to build Enzo. Put

    ::

       MyProblemInitialize.o\ 
       Grid_MyProblemInitializeGrid.o\

    somewhere in the list of objects. If you want to make things really
    clean, you can add your own variable to the Makefile and have it
    driven by a command line switch, but this isn't necessary.

#. ``Grid.h``. You'll need to put
    ``MyProblemInitializeGrid`` in this the grid class definition. Put it
    with the rest of the ``*InitializeGrid`` routines.

#. ``InitializeNew.C``. Put
    ``MyProblemInitialize`` in ``InitializeNew``. At the end of the large block
    of ``*Initialize``, take the next unused ProblemType number and
    install your code. It should look something like this:

    .. code-block:: c

          // 61) Protostellar Collapse                                                                                 
          if (ProblemType == 61)
            ret = ProtostellarCollapseInitialize(fptr, Outfptr, TopGrid, MetaData);
        
          // 62) My New Problem 
          if ( ProblemType == 62 )
            ret = MyProblemInitialize(fptr, Outfptr, TopGrid, MetaData);
        
          // Insert new problem intializer here...                                                                     
        
          if (ret == INT_UNDEFINED) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Problem Type %"ISYM" undefined.\n", ProblemType);
            return FAIL;
          }

To call your problem generator, make sure ProblemType = 62 is in
your parameter file. (Or, if 62 is taken, whatever the next unused
value is.)

The return value ``ret`` is used to check for errors and invalid values
of ``ProblemType``. The function signature will be discussed in the
next section.

Also, don't forget to put the proto type at the top:

.. code-block:: c

    int MyProblemInitialize(FILE *fptr, FILE *Outfptr,
                                       HierarchyEntry &TopGrid,
                                       TopGridData &MetaData);

We will revisit ``InitializeNew`` at the end. For almost all problems,
this will be all you do for these three files.

MyProblemInitialize
-------------------

The primary drive routine is called ``MyProblemInitialize``. It
basically sets up some global values, problem specific values, and
the hierarchy before calling ``MyProblemInitializeGrid``.

Function Signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function signature of ``MyProblemInitialize`` is fairly rigid. It
should look exactly like the prototype you installed in
``InitializeNew``. There are 4 arguments that you'll almost certainly
need, and one additional argument that only rare problems will
need. You won't likely have any need to add any other arguments. In
order, they are:

#. ``FILE *fptr`` This is the pointer to the parameter file argument to
    Enzo. It's opened and closed in InitializeNew You can read
    parameters if you like, see below.

#. ``FILE *Outfptr`` This is the output pointer, a file called "amr.out."
    This file contains the derived details of your problem setup for
    your record. There is no necessary output for this, it's for the
    users convenience.

#. ``HierarchyEntry &TopGrid`` This is the pointer to the top of the
    Hierarchy Linked List. For details of the linked list,
    :doc:`../reference/LinkedLists`. For most problem types, it
    points to the undivided root grid, which is a grid the full size
    of the top grid, where you will be initializing your data. For
    problems that are too large for the entire root grid to be
    allocated, we use the ParallelRootGridIO functionality, to be
    discussed later. (Please read everything between here and there.)

#. ``TopGridData &MetaData`` This is the structure that contains the meta
    data describing the Top Grid. Things like boundary condition,
    problem domain size, rank, and dimension are stored here.
    See ``TopGridData.h`` for a complete list of the contents.

If you want to write a problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions,
for instance jet inflow, you will need to add a fifth argument to
the function (and, of course, it's called in ``InitializeNew``). This is
the external boundary, ``ExternalBoundary &Exterior``. This is the
External Boundary object, which you will need to deal with.  We will
not be discussing this here. If you need to be
doing a problem with boundary conditions other than the big 3
(periodic, reflecting, outflow) then we recommend you read the
entirety of this tutorial, then follow what's done with the
DoubleMach problem, which is problem type 4. You will also need to
examine ``Grid_SetExternalBoundaryValues.C``

Necessary Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The essential header files for ``MyProblemInitialize`` are the
following:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include "macros_and_parameters.h"
    #include "typedefs.h"
    #include "global_data.h"
    #include "Fluxes.h"
    #include "GridList.h"
    #include "ExternalBoundary.h"
    #include "Grid.h"
    #include "Hierarchy.h"
    #include "TopGridData.h"

These should be in this order, to ensure proper definitions across
different header files. You should be familiar with the two
standard headers <stdio.h> and <string.h>

In brief, these are:

- ``macros_and_parameters.h`` The standard set of macros. This takes
    care of the float promotion so its inclusion is
    **ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL**

- ``typedefs.h`` This takes
    care of enumerates for parameters like the hydro method.

- ``global_data.h`` There
    are a lot of global parameters in Enzo. This houses them.

- ``Fluxes.h`` Definition of the
    flux object. Not necessary for your objects, but I think its
    necessary for the later

- ``GridList.h`` I don't think
    this is necessary, but it's usually included.

- ``ExternalBoundary.h`` This defines the external boundary object. Even
    if you're not including the external boundary, it's
    necessary for the following headers.

- ``Grid.h`` This defines the grid
    class, which you'll definitely need.

- ``Hierarchy.h`` This defines the Hierarchy Entry linked list.

- ``TopGridData.h`` This defines the meta data object.

More information can be found in :doc:`../reference/Headers`.

Initializing Baryon Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At some point in your problem type setup, it is essential that the arrays
to hold BaryonField data are initialized. To do this, you must tell Enzo
what baryon fields exist in the problem, allocate the BaryonField arrays,
and label the fields so that they can be written out.

The easiest way to set up and allocate the fields is through a call to
``InitializeUniformGrid``. This function, found in ``Grid_InitializeUniformGrid.C``,
takes care of setting up the fields and allocating the arrays and
initializes the gas to a uniform state. You will still need to add
labels for output as described below.

The call to ``InitializeUniformGrid`` can simply be added in ``MyProblemInitialize.C``
before the call to the problem initializer as follows:

.. code-block:: c

        if (TopGrid.GridData->InitializeUniformGrid(MyProblemUniformDensity,
                                              MyProblemUniformTotalEnergy,
                                              MyProblemUniformTotalEnergy,
                                              MyProblemUniformVelocity,
                                              MyProblemUniformBField) == FAIL) {
                                                 ENZO_FAIL("Error in InitializeUniformGrid.");
                                                 }

Note that it is in theory possible to set up the BaryonFields manually in your test
problem without the call to ``InitializeUniformGrid``. This is done in some test
problems in the code base, but is discouraged as a call to ``InitializeUniformGrid``
is cleaner, simpler, and is already implemented. If for some reason you do need
to do the setup and allocation manually, look at ``Grid_InitializeUniformGrid.C``
to see how it is done. The field information must be done on every grid on every
processor, so it is essential that you do this step before exiting on remote grids.

Setting up Data Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two arrays that need to be filled in ``MyProblemInitialize``.
One of them is **ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL** for the functioning of the
code. These are ``DataLabel`` and ``DataUnits``. Both of these are arrays
of strings that will be used to label the HDF5 output files. Each
element of the array corresponds to an element of the BaryonField
array and MUST be defined in the same order as fields are entered in
``InitializeUniformGrid`` or elsewhere in your problem initializer.
There is not a mechanism to ensure that you do this right, so don't
screw it up.

DataLabel
^^^^^^^^^

This is the actual name of the field in the HDF5 file. Messing this
up is asking for trouble. If you're not using chemistry, you'll
want something that looks like this. If you change the actual
names, you guarantee that an analysis tool somewhere will break, so
don't do it. See
``CosmologySimulationInitialize.C`` for
a more complete list, including extra chemical species.

.. code-block:: c

      char *DensName = "Density";
      char *TEName   = "TotalEnergy";
      char *GEName   = "GasEnergy";
      char *Vel1Name = "x-velocity";
      char *Vel2Name = "y-velocity";
      char *Vel3Name = "z-velocity";
      i = 0;
      DataLabel[i++] = DensName;
      DataLabel[i++] = TEName;
      if (DualEnergyFormalism)
        DataLabel[i++] = GEName;
      DataLabel[i++] = Vel1Name;
      DataLabel[i++] = Vel2Name;
      DataLabel[i++] = Vel3Name;

DataUnits
^^^^^^^^^

The units really don't matter very much. They're usually set to
NULL

Reading from the Parameter File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to read in problem specific parameters. PLEASE do not
put problem specific parameters in the main parameter file reader.

The usual pattern reads each line of the parameter file, and tries
to match each line with a parameter. This allows the parameter file
to be independent of of order. The typical pattern looks like
this:

.. code-block:: c

      float MyVelocity, MyDensity;
      char line[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
      while (fgets(line, MAX_LINE_LENGTH, fptr) != NULL) {
       ret = 0;
    
        /* read parameters */
    
        ret += sscanf(line, "MyProblemVelocity      = %"FSYM,
                      &MyVelocity);
        ret += sscanf(line, "MyProblemDensity      = %"FSYM,
                      &MyDensity);
        if (ret == 0 && strstr(line, "=") && strstr(line, "MyProblem") &&
            line[0] != '#' && MyProcessorNumber == ROOT_PROCESSOR)
          fprintf(stderr,
             "warning: the following parameter line was not interpreted:\n%s\n",
                  line);
      }

If you're not familiar with these functions,
`here is a good list of standard C functions <http://www.cppreference.com/all_c_functions.html>`_.

The last line checks for errors in parameters that start with
``MyProblem``. Everything involving this routine should be prepended
with ``MyProblem``. In the file ``ReadParameterFile.C``, the parameter file
is read and any lines not recognized are thrown as errors; this is
the section identified with

.. code-block:: c

    /* check to see if the line belongs to one of the test problems */
    
You must add your prefix (in this
case, ``MyProblem``) to the list of test problem prefixes considered in
this section:

.. code-block:: c

        if (strstr(line, "MyProblem")           ) ret++;

or else it will register as an error.

.. _UnigridInitialize:

Calling the Grid Initializer: Unigrid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a small, unigrid problem, the problem initializer is called
using the standard Enzo function call procedure.

.. code-block:: c

    if( TopGrid.GridData->MyProblemInitializeGrid(MyVelocity, MyDensity) == FAIL ){
      fprintf(stderr,"MyProblemInitialize: Error in MyProblemInitializeGrid\n");
      return FAIL;

``TopGrid`` is the ``HierarchyEntry`` that starts the hierarchy linked
list. It's member ``GridData`` is a pointer to the actual grid object
that you will be modifying.

We will be discussing AMR problems, and large problems that require
parallel startup later.

.. _InitializeGrid:

MyProblemInitializeGrid
-----------------------

``MyProblemInitializeGrid`` is the member function of the grid class.
As a member function, it can access the private data, most
importantly ``BaryonField``. ``BaryonField`` is an array of pointers that
stores the actual data that the simulator is interested in.

.. code-block:: c

    float *BaryonField[MAX_NUMBER_OF_BARYON_FIELDS];

There are three important events that need to happen in
``MyProblemInitializeGrid.``

* Fill the ``FieldType`` array
* Allocate the ``BaryonField`` array with ``this->AllocateGrids()``
* Fill ``BaryonField`` with your desired initial conditions.

Ensuring the proper sequence of the first two is somewhat cumbersome, we
recommend simplifying by calling ``InitializeUniformGrid`` from ``MyTestInitialize``
before calling ``MyProblemInitialize.``

When setting your desired initial conditions, make sure to only set field values
on Grids which live on the current processor. In Enzo, each Grid is a
'real Grid' on one processor and a 'remote Grid', storing only metadata,
on other processors. Therefore, your problem initializer should include

    .. code-block:: c

      if (ProcessorNumber != MyProcessorNumber)
        return SUCCESS;

before setting field values.  

Finally, set up your test problem by setting the BaryonField values.
See the page on Baryon Field Access for details.
:ref:`BaryonFieldAccess`

If, for some reason, it is preferable to not call ``InitializeUniformGrid``, the
following must happen:

* Before the ``if( ProcessorNumber != MyProcessorNumber)`` conditional, ``FieldType``
  must be filled with values representing the correct fields, in the same order
  as was done in ``DataLabel`` and ``BaryonField.``  This must happen _before_
  the ``MyProcessorNumber`` check to ensure it happens on all grids on all
  tasks.   
* ``NumberOfBaryonFields`` must be  incremented while ``FieldType`` is filled.
* ``BaryonField`` must be allocated, _after_ the ``MyProcessorNumber``
  conditional.  This should be done by calling ``this->AllocateGrids()``.  Older
  instances of the code used ``new``, but this should be avoided.

Boiler plate code should look like this:

.. code-block:: c

    //This can be skipped if InitializeUniformGrid is used
    NumberOfBaryonFields = 0;
    FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Density;
    if( EquationOfState == 0 ){
        FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = TotalEnergy;
    }
    FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Velocity1;
    FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Velocity2;
    FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Velocity3;
    if( UseMHD ){
        FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield1;
        FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield2;
        FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = Bfield3;
    }
    if( HydroMethod == MHD_RK ){
        FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = PhiField;
    }
    if(DualEnergyFormalism) FieldType[NumberOfBaryonFields++] = InternalEnergy;

    //This is always necessary
    if (ProcessorNumber != MyProcessorNumber)
        return SUCCESS;

    //Skipped if InitializeUniformGrid is used
    this->AllocateGrids();

    //Care should be taken to ensure that BaryonField relations are not 
    //hard coded at any point: this should always be done
    int DensNum, GENum, Vel1Num, Vel2Num, Vel3Num, TENum, B1Num, B2Num, B3Num;
    this->IdentifyPhysicalQuantities(DensNum, GENum, Vel1Num, Vel2Num,
                                     Vel3Num, TENum, B1Num, B2Num, B3Num);

                            
    //And then set the values for the fields in the manner that suits your
    //problem.
    int index=0;
    for(int k=0; k<GridDimension[2];k++){
        for(int j=0; j<GridDimension[1];j++){
            for(int i=0; i<GridDimension[0]; i++){
               index = i+GridDimension[0]*(j+GridDimension[1]*k);
               BaryonField[DensNum][index] = 46.2; //define your problem here.
            }
        }
    }





Initializing AMR problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For problems that you want to initialize in an AMR fashion, all the previous
steps apply. However, instead of simply calling the problem initializer on the
Top Grid, one must now initialize a ``HierarchyEntry`` linked list (of which ``TopGrid``
is the head) and call the problem initializer on each subgrid. There are several
ways to do this, depending on the complexity of the code. One first needs to
understand the ``HierarchyEntry`` linked list. This Page gives a tutorial on the
linked lists, and links to examples in the code.

Using ParallelRootGridIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Main article: :doc:`NewTestProblem3`

``ParallelRootGridIO`` is a fairly complex piece of code. If you absolutely
must do this in the code, it is recommended that you read the description
of the inner workings of ``ParallelRootGridIO`` and then cloning what's done
for the ``CosmologyInitialize`` routines.
