Enzo Flow Chart
===============

`Here's a cartoon of
Enzo. <../_static/flowchart/main.html>`_ This was
written as a first look at the details of how Enzo works.  Black
arrows indicate further flow charts. Grey boxes (usually) indicate
direct links to the source code.

No guarantees are made regarding the correctness of this flowchart --
it's meant to help get a basic understanding of the flow of Enzo
before extensive code modifications. This flowchart is certainly
out of date and contains inaccuracies. The user should consult the 
source code for an up-to-date look at how Enzo works. The purpose 
of this flowchart is just to get a rough idea of how Enzo works,
but it does not show the exact order of operations, and it does not 
show all the methods that exist in the Enzo source code.
