This test must be run on 2 cores, otherwise the problem isn't triggered.


This test is to ensure that MaximumGravityRefinement is functional.  As of this
writing (2014-07-12) when MaximumGravityRefinement < MaximumRefinementLevel, the
wrong SiblingList is used in PrepareDensityField.  

The current test creates 2 grids on Level 1, and one grid on Level 2, in which
case the code tries to iterate over the SiblingList for level=1 when on level=2.
This causes a seg fault.
