This test is the standard Orszag-Tang test at low resolution with AMR.  
The primary purpose of this test is to test the prolongation machinery, 
as well as the rest of the AMR.  
When an existing subgrid expands into new un-refined territory, 
fine grids from the previous timestep must be included in the refinement.
This test uses the EvolveRefineRegion machinery to evolve the refined region
into new territory.  This test fails if it generates DivB larger than 1e-8 in
double precision.
