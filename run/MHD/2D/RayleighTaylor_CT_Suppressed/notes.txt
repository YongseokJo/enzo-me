MHD suppresses the Rayleigh Taylor instability (in 2D)
This is set with a magnetic field that is just slightly below the critical value
for complete suppression, but one does see a severe reduction in growth rate and
secondary instability.

Fun things to try include reducing the field strength and changing the
direction!
