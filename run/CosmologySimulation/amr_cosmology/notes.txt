This is a cosmology simulation with Cen & Ostriker star
formation/feedback, cooling with Grackle, and initial conditions made
with MUSIC. It consists of a 32 Mpc/h box with 32^3 root grid cells
and dark matter particles and 5 levels of AMR.

This simulation will run to z = 0 in about 10 minutes on a single
core. To run this, you will need to copy the file,
CloudyData_UVB=HM2012.h5, from the input directory of your Grackle
source, to the run directory of the simulation.

To generate the ICs with MUSIC:
./MUSIC amr_cosmology.conf

Initial conditions can also be downloaded from the "Enzo test data"
collection on the yt Hub (hub.yt), or do:
pip install girder-client
girder-cli --api-url https://girder.hub.yt/api/v1 download 5afb0040ec1bd30001fcd002

To run the simulation:
./enzo.exe -d amr_cosmology.enzo
