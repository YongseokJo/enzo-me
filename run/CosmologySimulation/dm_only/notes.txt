This is a dark-matter-only version of the amr_cosmology simulation. It
consists of a 32 Mpc/h box with 32^3 dark matter particles and 5
levels of AMR. This simulation will run to z = 0 in less than a minute
on a single core.

To generate the ICs with MUSIC:
./MUSIC dm_only.conf

Initial conditions can also be downloaded from the "Enzo test data"
collection on the yt Hub (hub.yt), or do:
pip install girder-client
girder-cli --api-url https://girder.hub.yt/api/v1 download 5afb0145ec1bd30001fcd024

To run the simulation:
./enzo.exe -d dm_only.enzo
