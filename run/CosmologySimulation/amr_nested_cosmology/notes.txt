This is a variation of the amr_cosmology simulation with 1 level of
initial refinement and must-refine-particles. The simulation uses Cen
& Ostriker star formation/feedback, cooling with Grackle, and initial
conditions made with MUSIC. The nested refinement zooms in on the most
massive halo in the box at z = 1.8. Must-refine-particles are used to
allow AMR only for particles that end up within 3 virial radii of the
most massive halo at z = 1.8. The simulation will run in about 1
minute on a single core.

The zoom initial conditions with must-refine-particle flagging was
created using the method outlined in
https://bitbucket.org/jwise77/enzo-mrp-music

Initial conditions can be downloaded from the "Enzo test data"
collection on the yt Hub (hub.yt), or do:
pip install girder-client
girder-cli --api-url https://girder.hub.yt/api/v1 download 5afef79bec1bd30001fcd07e

To run the simulation:
./enzo.exe -d amr_nested_cosmology.enzo
