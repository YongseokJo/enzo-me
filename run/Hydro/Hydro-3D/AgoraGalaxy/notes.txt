The initial conditions for this problem depend on star and dark matter particle
data files that must be generated using the MakeGalaxy code.

Example star particle data files corresponding to the AGORA isolated galaxy
initial conditions can be found at the following URL:

The included test problem parameter file corresponds to the LOW initial
conditions (80 pc resolution).  Follow the readme.txt and use the IPython
notebook to adjust the parameter file if you want to simulate a galaxy at
different resolution.

Enzo must be compiled with new-problem-types-yes and grackle-yes for this test
problem to function correctly. The bash script prepare_sim.sh downloads and
extracts the necessary grackle data file and initial conditions. Run it in the
directory you would like to run the test simulation.

If run to completion, this simulation needs about 200 gigabytes of free space.
If you are constrained by hard disk space, consider decreasing the output
interval (1 Myr of physical time per output by default).  The simulation should
finish in approximately 12 hours when run on 16 cores.  Of course, your mileage
may vary for the amount of wallclock time necessary.
