Note, this has not been tested much. 
It uses the machinery for the MHD2D tests in hydro_rk. 
It should also work with PPM (i.e. HydroMethod = 0) but is not setup to do Zeus (HydroMethod=1 tests). 
However, HydroMethod=3 offers many options for Riemann Solvers and Slope limiting which may be interesting to test. 

To run in parallel keep the ParallelRootgridIO = 1 on.

This is a code test for a limit high resolution shock captruing codes are not often optimized for.
It is useful to see whether your choice of hydro method has sufficient diffusivity to give behave sensibly in
a convergence study.
