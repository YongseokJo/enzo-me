PhotonTest
----------

This test is derived from the PhotonTest problem which is itself
based on the classical HII region expansion in a uniform
static medium similar to Test 1 in Iliev et al. (2006). Rather than 
a mono-chromatic source this source contains 7 frequency bins from 0.5 eV 
up to 100 eV. It can be used to test the multi-frequency photon solver. In a separate
subdirectory is the optically thin version (OT) which runs with H2 and HM dissociation
run in optically thin mode.

This test runs with Grackle.
