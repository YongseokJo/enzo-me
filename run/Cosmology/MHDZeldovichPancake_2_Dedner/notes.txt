This is another iteration of Zel'Dovich pancake.  This is tuned to almost 
reproduce the result from Collins et al 2010, as well as the Dedner run in 
run/Cosmology/MHDZeldovichPancake_2_CT

Slight differences with the method paper exist due to the uniform initial
distribution in the method paper.  

Neither this nor the CT version use Dual Energy Formalism, in order to match
the temperature field as well as possible.

This is similar to the other Pancake, but with different Riemann solver,
reconstruction, and dual energy.
