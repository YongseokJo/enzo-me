This is another iteration of Zel'Dovich pancake.  This is tuned to almost 
reproduce the result from Collins et al 2010, as well as the Dedner run in 
run/Cosmology/MHDZeldovichPancake_2_Dedner

Slight differences with the method paper exist due to the uniform initial
distribution in the method paper.  

Neither this nor the Dedner version use Dual Energy Formalism, in order to match
the temperature field as well as possible.
