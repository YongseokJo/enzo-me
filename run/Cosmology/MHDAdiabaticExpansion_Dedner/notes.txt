Adiabatic expansion test for MHD, using Dedner.

This test differs from the PPM Adiabatic Expansion by the increased initial
temperature.  The extremely low floor on the PPM version makes it a poor test,
since the thermal expansion is dominated by the temperature floor, rather than
physical integration. 

This test is not entirely uniform for two reasons.  
First is self gravity (actually off in this version) which causes issues at the
corners of the domain as well as subgrid boundary.
The second is the time-interpolation in the boundary for the subgrid, which
causes slight acceleration due to slightly different expansion of the fluid in
the boundary of the subgrid relative to the "ideal" solution.
