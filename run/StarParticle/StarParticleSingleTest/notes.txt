StarParticleSingleTest
----------------------

This test places a single star particle in the center of a box with uniform
gas density and thermal energy.  The gas is initially at rest.  The particle 
will then produce feedback according to the method set for 
StarParticleFeedback.  

By default, the star particle produces feedback with method 14, kinetic 
feedback.  An inital timestep is set to account for the large bulk velocities 
created by the feedback event in the first timestep.  

The particle is also set to be at rest by default, but it can be given a motion
relative to the gas with the parameter TestStarParticleStarVelocity = vx vy vz, 
where vx, vy and vz have units of km/s.
