[Review criteria](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html)



From the JOSS website:  JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. For this reason, we require that authors include in the paper some sentences that would explain the software functionality and domain of use to a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be somewhere between 250-1000 words.

In addition, your paper should include:

A list of the authors of the software and their affiliations
A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience
A clear statement of need that illustrates the purpose of the software
A list of key references including a link to the software archive
Mentions (if applicable) of any ongoing research projects using the software or recent scholarly publications enabled by it
Acknowledgement of any financial support
As this short list shows, JOSS papers are only permitted to contain a limited set of metadata (see header below), Statement of Need, Summary, Acknowledgements, and References sections. You can see an example accepted paper here. Given this paper format, a “full length” paper is not permitted, e.g., software documentation such as API (Application Programming Interface) functionality should not be in the paper and instead should be outlined in the software documentation.
